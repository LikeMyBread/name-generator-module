The default export is a function called name() with three parameters.

The first paramater, "fantasy" defaults to false. If true, the result is a fantasy style name, if false, the result is a realistic sounding modern name.
The second parameter, "first" defaults to true. If true, the result is a first or personal name, if false, the result is a last or family name.
The third parameter, "gender" has four possible string values:
  -"androgynous": names that do not have a strong gender association
  -"female": names that were marked as female in US Census data
  -"male": names that were marked as male in US Census data
  -"any" (also the default): a random name, regardless of gender associations
